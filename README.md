# README

This was a practice rails app building a blog app from scratch. Used rails, HTML, CSS and new gems to me like will_paginate. Created navbar with the navbar template and made personal preference changes. There is extra section showing debugger at bottom, I haven't gotten rid of yet, It has something to do with clashing gems, still working on that
